## QUESTION 1
### The functional requirements of the Library Information System (LIS) system are as follows:
* ***User registration/sign-up:*** The system should provide a feature through which the users can register/sign-up for the Library Information System (LIS).  
* ***User login:*** The system should provide a feature through which the users can log in to the Library Information System (LIS). 
* ***Issue/Return book:*** The system should only allow the valid users/members(students and employees of the institute) to issue and return books.
* ***Search/Browse books:*** The system should have a search functionality via which all the users (both members and non-members) can search and browse books according to the title of the book, author of the book, etc.
* ***Extension of date of return:*** The system should enable a member to extend the date of return of the book, if no other booking for that particular book has been made, else should reject the extension.
* ***Calculate fine:*** The system should calculate the fine for each day, if the user fails to return the book on time.
* ***Store user details:*** The system should store the details of the user who has issued any book, the name of the book, the date of issue, and the date of return.
* ***Reject the request:*** The system should reject the request of the user if the user is requesting to issue the book that has been already issued or pre-booked by some other user or the user is requesting to issue or pre-book the same book that he/she has already issued or pre-booked.
* ***Enter a new record:*** The system should only allow the librarian administrative staff to enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased.
* ***Remove existing record:*** The system should only allow the librarian administrative staff to remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.

### The non-functional requirements are as follows:

* The final deliverable should be a web application (using the recent HTML 5).
* The confidential information (like passwords) used in the authentication system should be properly encrypted to avoid any cyber attack.
* The application  should be responsive to all screen sizes.
* The application should run only within the institute LAN.
### Some other non-functional requirements:
* ***Usability:*** The application should ease the interaction of users with the system.
* ***Scalability:*** The system should be able to handle increasing amounts of data or users.
* ***Reliability:*** The system should perform consistently as expected by the users.
* ***Robustness:*** The system should handle unexpected inputs or conditions.
* ***Security:*** The system should provide protection against unauthorized access or manipulation.
* ***Privacy:*** The system should protect the personal information of users.
* ***Maintainability:*** The system should be updated or modified with ease.

***Portability, risk, authentication, performance, etc,*** are some of the other non-functional requirements.

## QUESTION 2

### Scope:

The scope of this application is to create an impactful solution for the community suffering from disabling hearing loss that addresses some of their everyday needs. The scope of AI in hearing aid applications is to improve the performance of hearing aids by improving noise reduction capabilities, improving speech recognition capabilities, providing personalized sound processing, etc.

### Features:

* ***User registration/sign-up:*** The system should provide a feature through which the users can register/sign-up for the application.  
* ***User login:*** The system should provide a feature through which the users can log in to the application. 
* ***Noise reduction:*** The AI application can be used to attenuate background noise, thus facilitating it for users to understand speech in chaotic surroundings.
* ***Speech enhancement:*** The AI application can be used to increase speech volume in comparison to other sounds, thereby improving the user's hearing  and comprehension.
* ***Personalization:*** The AI application can be used to modify the settings of a hearing aid in order to better suit individual users' requirements and preferences.
* ***Fall detection and alert:*** The AI application can be used to detect falls and notify a caretaker or emergency contact.
* ***Remote fitting:*** The AI application can be used to remotely adjust the settings of a hearing aid, eliminating the need for in-person appointments.
* ***Speech recognition:*** The AI application can be used to transcribe speech to text, enabling users to read what's being said. 

***Activity Tracking, Engagement Tracking, Reminders, etc,*** are some of the other features.

### Non-functional aspects:

The AI application should be optimized with low latency which can be achieved by allocating web servers and database servers in the cloud like AWS and Azure, so that it works in real-time for use.
* ***Usability:*** The application should ease the interaction of users with the system.
* ***Scalability:*** The system should be able to handle increasing amounts of data or users.
* ***Reliability:*** The system should perform consistently as expected by the users.
* ***Robustness:*** The system should handle unexpected inputs or conditions.
* ***Security:*** The system should provide protection against unauthorized access or manipulation.
* ***Privacy:*** The system should protect the personal information of users.
* ***Maintainability:*** The system should be updated or modified with ease.

***Portability, risk, authentication, performance, etc,*** are some of the other non-functional requirements.
